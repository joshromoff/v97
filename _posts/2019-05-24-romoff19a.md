abstract: In many finite horizon episodic reinforcement learning (RL) settings, it
  is desirable to optimize for the undiscounted return - in settings like Atari, for
  instance, the goal is to collect the most points while staying alive in the long
  run. Yet, it may be difficult (or even intractable) mathematically to learn with
  this target. As such, temporal discounting is often applied to optimize over a shorter
  effective planning horizon. This comes at the cost of potentially biasing the optimization
  target away from the undiscounted goal. In settings where this bias is unacceptable
  - where the system must optimize for longer horizons at higher discounts - the target
  of the value function approximator may increase in variance leading to difficulties
  in learning. We present an extension of temporal difference (TD) learning, which
  we call TD($\Delta$), that breaks down a value function into a series of components
  based on the differences between value functions with smaller discount factors.
  The separation of a longer horizon value function into these components has useful
  properties in scalability and performance. We discuss these properties and show
  theoretic and empirical improvements over standard TD learning in certain settings.
